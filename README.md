 # Hosting and Backend
 
The current version of the game on this branch "master-dev" is connected to, and hosted on the free AWS tier "Amplify" [here](https://master-dev.d28ds4nnoxwdjw.amplifyapp.com). Any changes that are made to this branch will automatically update the game on the link with a small delay for the server to update of a couple of minutes. It is currently hosted by Wilhelm and will be kept online until the end of 2020. 

Backend TBD
